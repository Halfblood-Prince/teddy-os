# Running Teddy-OS In VMware

## VM Settings

- Guest type: Other
- Firmware: BIOS / Legacy
- Attach ISO: `build/dist/teddy-os-debug.iso`
- Video memory: default is fine

## Expected Result

You should see:

- a black text-mode screen
- a `TEDDY-OS` title
- a `Legacy BIOS stage 2 online` status line
- a `Boot OK - Stage 2 running` footer
- a `>` shell prompt that responds to keyboard input

Try `graphics` at the prompt. You should see a simple Teddy-OS graphics screen
and return to the shell after pressing a key.

Try `kernel` at the prompt. You should see Teddy-OS switch into a protected-mode
64-bit Rust kernel screen and stop there in a halt loop.

If that screen appears and remains stable, the reset baseline is working.
